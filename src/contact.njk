                                            It takes approximately 2-8 weeks to build a website from start to finish, providing we have all the information from you. Generally speaking, the website will only take a long time if we are still waiting for text and images from yourself.

                                            Before we begin working together, we’ll usually have an initially chat on the phone or via Skype to discuss the project. Once we get started, most of the communication will take place over email.
        
                                            This makes the process a lot easier as we’ll have all of the information saved and can come back to it later.

                                          You’re in luck. We offer a risk-free guarantee. Before we build your new website, we’ll design a mockup of your homepage. We’ll design a layout in Figma first, that way you’ll get to see our initial designs within approximately ten days. This is your opportunity to give us feedback and if you really don’t like it, you don’t have to move forward. Best part is, this won’t cost you anything.
